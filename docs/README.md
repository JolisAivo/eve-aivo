The application for your [EVE Online](https://www.eveonline.com/signup?invc=1564e70d-420f-44bf-bed9-eeaa1a645525) Capsuleer. Written by a Capsuleer for the Capsuleer.

EVE Online is a massive online virtual existence. It is a perfect bed to create, test, and deploy many non-virtual business solutions within an environment that is safe but brutal as well as all-encompassing. The social structure environment is set up as corporations, with leadership and laymen throughout the workings. Many needs of a business are reflected within this virtual existence. Admittedly, this is a video game, and real-life requirements take precedence. So the needs are more reflective of a volunteer organization more than a corporate environment. Never-the-less, there are fringe groups out there that operate as a corporate structure. The Capsuleer represented in this project accesses one of the largest groups that exist within EVE Online. Through his contacts, he will be able to push out testers and gain access to these individuals who take life as a Capsuleer as seriously as most take a non-virtual life.

The domain [app.aivoeve.space](https://app.aivoeve.space) will direct to the current version of the application as it is being developed.
